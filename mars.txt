Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour: namely RED(ish)!
This was fun to collaborate! Thanks Michael!

MARS NEWS:
Nasa's Mars lander sends back first pictures from red planet!  InSight probe
reveals desolate landscape as dust settles after its arrival on Martian surface.

Hopefully the probe will return some good data.

MYTHOLOGY:
In ancient Roman religion and myth, Mars was the god of war and also an
agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome. He was second
in importance only to Jupiter and he was the most prominent of the military gods
in the religion of the Roman army. Most of his festivals were held in March, the
month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began the season for
military campaigning and ended the season for farming.
